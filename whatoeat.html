                    <p class="paragraph">Rice cannot get any more portable than this. More commonly known       as “hanging rice”. 
                        Puso rice is boiled and wrapped in coconut leaves, and you will most likely notice them hanging in batches in local eateries.
                        The coconut leaves impart flavour and serve as an easy package that you can carry anywhere. The versatile Puso rice can be paired with street foods, Lechon, or anything else you can get your hands on.

                            Cebu claims to have the best-roasted pork in the Philippines, offering up Lechon as proof. This dish is quite the local trademark for Cebuanos. You can buy a whole pig, and have them chop it into manageable pieces. Some Lechon houses have made provisions so that their product can be carried through air and land travel.

                        Coming from the Spanish word which means “stew pot”, Pochero is another dish that you should watch out for in Cebu, especially during the rainy season. There is nothing better than to indulge in a hot bowl of beef soup during cold weather. Some other Filipinos might know of this dish by its other name, Bulalo.

                             This staple is comparable to the famous spring roll, and it’s deep fried and mainly made of Ubod (bamboo shoots) and ground pork. Each place has its own unique mix of Ngohiong, so don’t expect them all to be the same.<br>
                        You can eat them with other well-known street foods like squid balls, tempura, chorizo, and many more. With its strong flavour, this dish goes really well with a bowl of rice.
