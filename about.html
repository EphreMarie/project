                    Hello! I'm Ephrem Marie Pasok. 19 years of existence. Born on 9th of June in the year 2000. Originally from Ormoc City but had to go to Cebu for academic purposes. Currently taking up Bachelor of Science in Information Technology in my first year in college        at University of San Carlos. It is my dream to be a web designer but this is the         first time I designed so maybe you can say it's not that impressive. I'm still on       the process of learning and gladly I enjoyed it. And now, let me tell you a little        about my self.
                </p>
                <p class="info">
                    I'm the youngest of Rio Wilson Pasok who is a Mechanical Engineer
                    and Avelina Pasok who is a businesswoman and a Zumba Instructor.
                    I've got 3 siblings namely, Rio Ave Pasok (a registered Pharmacist),
                    John Linwell Pasok (registered Mechanical Engineer) and Hazel
                    Nathalie Pasok (registered Business Accountant). Well as what people say,
                    the youngest of the family are most likely to be spoiled because all
                    of the attention are on them but in my case, I'm the opposite.
                    For me, the behavior depends on our parents raised us.
                </p>

                    I would like to tell you a little about my appearance. My hair is
                    short and a little bit brownish. To speak about my face, I've got
                    pimples, a flat nose, thin lips and chubby cheeks. Even though I
                    don't like some of them, I didn't think of having a plastic surgery. I
                    think we lost our uniqueness day by day. Let's be contented of what
                    God has given us! We're created by his own image and likeness.                   You're unique! We're unique!
                </p>
                <p class="info">
                    Hobbies? Hmm, I'm the introvert type. I'd rather watch Korean
                    movies (YES! I'm a big fan of the KPOP Industry) and lock myself in a
                    room rather than hanging out with my friends. I don't mind being
                    alone in the house all day as long as there's internet. I love listening
                    to pop music ♫ I was once an athlete of the Track & Field but had                   to stop as I am going to transfer to another school. I love eating
                    because food is life ♥
